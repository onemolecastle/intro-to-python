Counting the Number of Even and Odd Numbers in a List

Write a program that uses a for loop to count the number of even and odd numbers in a list.

The program should define a list of numbers and initialize two variables called even_count and odd_count to zero.

Then, the program should use a for loop to iterate over the list of numbers, checking if each number is even or odd.
If a number is even, the program should increment the even_count variable. If a number is odd, the program
should increment the odd_count variable.

Finally, the program should print the number of even and odd numbers.
