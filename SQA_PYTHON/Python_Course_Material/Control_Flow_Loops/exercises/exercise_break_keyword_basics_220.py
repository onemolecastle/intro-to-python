# Challenge 1: Break on Negative Number
# Given a list of numbers, write a loop that prints each number until it encounters a negative number, at which point it should stop.


# Challenge 2: User Input Break
# Write a program that continuously asks the user to enter a word until they type 'exit'. Then, the program should print "Loop exited" and stop.


# Challenge 3: Find First Even Number
# Given a list of numbers, print the first even number encountered and stop the loop.


# Challenge 4: Skip to a Specific Letter
# Iterate over a string and stop when you reach the letter 'm'. Print all letters up until 'm'.


# Challenge 5: Exit Loop on Duplicate Entry
# Given a list of names, stop the loop and print "Duplicate name found" when a duplicate name is encountered.


# Challenge 6: While Loop with User Confirmation
# Continuously ask the user to confirm if they want to continue. Exit the loop with a "Goodbye" message if they say 'no'.


# Challenge 7: Guessing Game with Limit
# Implement a guessing game where the user has 3 attempts to guess a number (let's say 5). Use a while loop and break if they guess correctly.


# Challenge 8: Breaking Out of Nested Loops
# Given a nested list of numbers, stop searching once you find the number 7. Print "Found 7" and exit both loops.
